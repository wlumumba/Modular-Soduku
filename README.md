# Modular-Soduku
This project implements recursion algorithm to find best possible solution for user generated soduku puzzle.
# Motivation
I built this project in order to see how recursion can be used to create a meaningful project.
# How to use:
- Simply clone the entire repo, and **run the driver excectuable** in a C environment
- Program will print the puzzle solution to console, or "no solution found"
# How to change input:
- "Driver.c" file contains a 2D array (grid) which represents a soduku puzzle
- You can change the puzzle by editing the values contained inside grid.
